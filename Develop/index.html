            <h2>The End Time Message</h2>
            <p>
                We claim to believe as the Holy Scripture says and acknowledge with thankful hearts that we are now living close to the second coming of Christ. We see Bible prophecies fulfilled as it was at His first coming. The New Testament began with the fulfilment of scriptural prophecies and ends the same way. The promise that a voice would cry in the wilderness (Isa. 40:3) and that the Lord would send His messenger to prepare His way (Mal. 3:1) became a living reality in the ministry of John the Baptist. This we find confirmed in Mt. 11:10; Mk. 1:1-4; Lk. 1:16-17; Jn. 1:19-28.

            <h2>The Ministry of Mathew 24,45-47 in our time</h2>
            <p>
                Rev. Frank began to preach in 1953 and then attended the meetings of Rev.
                 William M. Branham in Karlsruhe, Germany, from the 12th to the 21st of August 1955. What he experienced at that time he only knew up till then from the reports of the New Testament. Blind could see, lame were made whole instantly and could walk, the deaf could suddenly hear end so forth.
